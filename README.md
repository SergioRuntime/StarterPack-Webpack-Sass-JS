# StarterPack-Webpack-Sass-JSX

👨🏻‍💻 This is a reusable example to start my *FrontEnd* projects and speed up my work. It does not mean that I always use it but it's good to have support for my future projects.


You can now use `npm run dev` to have the devServer up and running which you can visit in your browser at `localhost:4040`

It's ready and configured to start your *FrontEnd* proyect with **Webpack / Sass / ReactJs**.

## Versions:
- Webpack: 2.24.4
