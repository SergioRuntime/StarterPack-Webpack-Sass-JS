# StarterPack-Webpack-Sass-JSX

👨🏻‍💻 This is a reusable example to start my *FrontEnd* projects and speed up my work. It does not mean that I always use it but it's good to have support for my future projects.


The dev task simply stores the file in memory and makes it available at localhost:4040

It's ready and configured to start your *FrontEnd* proyect with **Webpack / Sass / ReactJs**.
